Simple Job scheduler
--------------------

The aim of the project is to provide a simple
solution to run local jobs using a job queue
paradigm in which there are some queues with 
parameters (such as the maximum number of 
running jobs, priorities) and a scheduler which
is responsible for spawning new jobs upon need.
